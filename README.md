# Smart Attendance AI Project

## Overview

This project implements a smart attendance system using AI. It leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to automate attendance tracking. The application uses Python, OpenCV, Tkinter, and various other libraries to provide a user-friendly interface and accurate attendance recording.

## Features

- **Face Recognition**: Automatically recognize and record attendance based on facial features.
- **User Interface**: Built with Tkinter for an interactive and easy-to-use interface.
- **Image Handling**: Includes functionalities to capture and train images for recognition.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tortejumpy/SMART-ATTENDENCE-USING-AI.git
   cd SMART-ATTENDENCE-USING-AI
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Here is the `requirements.txt` file for reference:

   ```plaintext
   cx_Freeze
   numpy
   opencv-python
   Pillow
   pandas
   tkinter
   ```

3. **Build the Executable:**

   To build the executable, use the provided `setup.py` script with cx_Freeze. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python setup.py build
   ```

   After building, the executable will be located in the `build` directory.

4. **Run the Application:**

   Navigate to the `build` directory and execute the application to start using it.

## Usage

- **Take Images**: Capture images for training.
- **Train Images**: Train the model using captured images.
- **Track Images**: Start tracking and recognizing faces.
